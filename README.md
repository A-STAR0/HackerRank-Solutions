# HackerRank Solutions #

####*New Questions Added Regularly*####

Looking to land your next job interview, wreck noobs in coding competitions, or just improve
your current understanding of algorithms? You've come to the right place.

This repository is a home for well-documented solutions to problems found on HackerRank, an epitome of competitive coding. Most of the solutions you'll find here are written by yours truly, but I'll also 
include solutions from other developers who wish to contribute. All solutions must include an
adequate explanation that is relative to the difficulty of the problem.

In addition to solutions, there's also a list of *useful code blocks* and *valuable resources* that 
you should take a look at it if you're looking for more tips & tricks.

If you would like to help contribute to this repository, you should:
a) Open an issue to request a solution/explanation of a problem
b) Make a pull request if you'd like to add a solution yourself

All contributions are much appreciated! :)
