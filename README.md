# HackerRank Solutions #

####*New Questions Added Regularly*####

Looking to land your next job interview, wreck noobs in coding competitions, or just improve
your current understanding of algorithms? You've come to the right place.

This repository is a home for well-documented solutions to problems found on HackerRank. Most of the solutions you'll find here are written by yours truly, but I'll also include solutions from other developers who wish to contribute. There are two criteria for submitting a solution:
* Code should be well-written and easy to follow
* Code should contain an adequate explanation relative to the difficulty of the problem (this means comments!)

In addition to solutions, you'll also find a list of *Useful Code Blocks* and *Valuable Resources* in
the root folder that you should take a look at it if you're looking for additional help.

If you would like to help contribute to this repository, you should:
a) Open an issue to request a solution/explanation of a problem
b) Make a pull request if you'd like to add a solution yourself

All contributions are much appreciated! :)
