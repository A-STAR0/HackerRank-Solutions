# HackerRank Solutions #

####*New Questions Added Regularly*####

Looking to land your next job interview, score higher in coding competitions, or just improve
your current understanding of algorithms? You've come to the right place.

This repository is a home for elegant solutions to problems found on HackerRank. Most of the code you'll find here is written by yours truly, but I'll also include solutions from any other developers who wish to contribute. All pull requests should follow two important sets of criteria:
* Code should be as simplistic as possible, making solutions easy to follow
* Solutions should contain explanations that are adequate for the difficulty of the problem being solved

In addition to solutions for Hackerrank problems, you'll also find a list of *Useful Code Blocks* and *Valuable Resources* in
the root folder that you should take a look at it if you're looking for additional help.

If you would like to help contribute to this repository, you should:
* Open an issue to request a solution/explanation of a Hackerrank problem
* Make a pull request if you'd like to add a solution yourself

All contributions are much appreciated! :)
